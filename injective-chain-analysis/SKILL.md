# Injective Chain Analysis Skill

## Overview

Analyze Injective chain-level protocol code (Go/Cosmos SDK). Explain exchange module mechanics, review spec completeness, and trace execution paths for derivatives trading features.

## Injective Exchange Module

The exchange module (`x/exchange`) handles all trading on Injective. Key areas:

### Derivative Markets
- `MsgCreateDerivativeMarketOrder` / `MsgCreateDerivativeLimitOrder`
- Position management: open, close, reduce, increase
- Margin: initial margin, maintenance margin, margin ratio checks
- Liquidation: forced closure when margin ratio < maintenance margin

### Position Offsetting (`MsgOffsetPosition`)
- Allows netting opposing positions between subaccounts
- Reduces total margin requirements
- Chain-level implementation in `derivative_liquidations.go`

### Liquidation Engine
- Triggered when position margin < maintenance margin requirement
- Liquidator receives a portion of remaining margin as reward
- Insurance fund covers negative PnL if position is underwater
- Code path: `derivative_liquidations.go` → `ExecuteLiquidation()`

### Funding Rates
- Calculated every hour for perpetual markets
- Formula: `FundingRate = (TWAP_perp - TWAP_oracle) / TWAP_oracle`
- Capped by `MaxFundingRate` parameter per market
- Applied to all open positions proportional to quantity

### Market Parameters
- `InitialMarginRatio`, `MaintenanceMarginRatio`
- `MakerFeeRate`, `TakerFeeRate` (can be negative for rebates)
- `MinPriceTickSize`, `MinQuantityTickSize`
- `OracleType`, `OracleScaleFactor`

## Analysis Approach

When asked to analyze chain code:
1. **Read the Go source** from the user's local clone or fetch from GitHub (`InjectiveLabs/injective-core`)
2. **Trace the execution path** from message handler → keeper → state changes
3. **Explain in plain English** what the code does, step by step
4. **Identify spec gaps** — what's missing, ambiguous, or could break
5. **Compare to docs** — check if behavior matches published documentation

## Cosmos SDK Context
- Injective is built on Cosmos SDK (currently v0.47.x)
- Uses Tendermint BFT consensus
- Exchange module is a custom Cosmos SDK module
- State stored in IAVL tree via keeper pattern
- Messages processed in `DeliverTx` phase of ABCI
